CALCULATE Syntax
Filters are evaluated in the outer filter context, then combined together in AND and finally
used to build a new filter context into which DAX evaluates the expression
CALCULATE (
Expression,
Filter1,
â€¦
Filtern
)
# Repeated many times, as needed

Example:

NumOfBigSales =
  CALCULATE(
    SUM( Sales[SalesAmount]),
    Sales[SalesAmount] > 100
    )
    
    
Example:

Red Sales CALCULATE =
  CALCULATE(
  [Sales Amount],
  'Product'[Color] = "Red"
  )
  

  
CALCULATE Examples
Compute the sum of sales where the price is more than $100.00
NumOfBigSales :=
CALCULATE (
SUM ( Sales[SalesAmount] ),
Sales[SalesAmount] > 100
)
Filter and SUM are
on the same table.
You can obtain the same
result using FILTER
