Measure:

Line Margin = Quantity * (Net Price - Unit Cost)

For Calculated Column:
Data Model -> Add Column

Line Margin = Sales[Quantity] * (Sales[Net Price] - Sales[Unit Cost])
Line Margin % = Sales[Line Margin]/Sales[Line Amount]

To convert or format Line Margin into % => Clikc on that Column -> Modelling tab -> Under Formatting -> Click on %

But it would be wrong

Measures:
wont calculate Line by line but on aggregate level

For Mesures:
Viz View, Modeling tab -> New Measure

Margin % = SUM( SUM(Sales[Line Margin]) / SUM([Sales[Line Amount]]))
Format as %

Measures do not belong to a table
- Avoid table name
- [Margin %] instead of Sales[Margin %]
- Easier to move to another table
- Easier to identify as a measure

Thus,
- Calcualted columns -> Table[Column]
- Measures -> [Measures]
